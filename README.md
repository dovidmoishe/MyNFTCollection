# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Run these commands to start your frontend:

```shell
cd buildspace-nft-course-starter
npm install
npm run start
```
